# How to Execute 
### First of all

My code in Visual Studio don't execute like so many tutorials, so a I need to do 2 things before, first is select the interpreter. Press CTRL + SHIFT + P in VSCODE and write "python:select" go to the option that says "Python: Select Interpreter", after this select the path where is your python installed. Now the command "import" gonna work (and so many others commands in python)

### Open Terminal

To exec the code all you need is to open a terminal in VSCode pressing the keys  CTRL + SHIFT + ` now will open a terminal (powershell) and go to the path where you extracted the file. Use "ls" to display a list of the names of all files in the current directory and use "cd" to go to the folder you want.

### Finnaly
Type the command in terminal "py main.py", this will create a .txt file in the folder.


#### How to custom and Use

Put the image you want in the folder and change "TheImagemUWant.png" in the code, the "FileName.txt" you don't need to change but I recommend to put the same name as the .png.

##### That is it :D
